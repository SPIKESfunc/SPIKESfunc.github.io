							<b>Project Summary</b><br/>
							Agonists produce effects in cells by activating receptors and downstream signalling pathways. This app contains an interactive “Dose Response Visualiser” which allows users to alter agonist-dependent factors (affinity, intrinsic efficacy) and/or cell-dependent factors (receptor density, signal amplification) and observe in real time how this changes the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Agonist-induced effects can be blocked by drugs called antagonists, which are amongst the most widely used class of drug in medicine. There exist many different types of antagonists, named on the basis of how they inhibit the agonist-induced effect: competitive, irreversible, allosteric and functional antagonists, and inverse agonists. Within the “Dose Response Visualiser”, users can observe the different patterns of effect produced by each of these antagonists (and the influence of antagonist concentrations and affinity) on the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Quantitative analysis of the effect of competitive antagonists on agonist-induced effects is a powerful method for identifying the receptors that mediate agonist-induced effects (Schild analysis), and is used in drug discovery and receptor characterisation. The app contains a “Schild Plot Generator”, where users can select the properties of agonists and antagonists and generate Schild Plots, and work through a series of theoretical questions and experimental scenarios that build proficiency and enhance understanding of key Schild concepts.  The “Schild Plot Generator” also introduces users to a wide array of ‘non-ideal’ Schild Plots (e.g. nonlinear and/or slope different from unity), and moreover, provides users with information that can be used to identify and remedy the underlying causes of each form of ‘non-ideal’ Schild plot.<br/>
							<br/>These newly developed proficiencies and understandings can then be tested using the “Schild Analysis Quiz” tool within the app, were users are provided with a series of Schild Plots obtained to 5 antagonists acting on a single receptor subtype within a common cell, and users are challenged to analyse each of the Schild Plots using the SPIKES approach to deduce which single receptor subtype is mediating the agonist-induced response.  Feedback is provided for each of the 1000s of different quiz questions.<br/>
							<br/>Additonally, there is access to various videos and detailed descriptions on non-ideal schild plots.<br/> 
							<br/>Thus, SPIKESfunc is an interactive, educational application that boosts proficiency in the interpretation of functional pharmacological data through the visual and quantitative analysis of agonist and antagonist dose-response relationships. SPIKESfunc can be used in conjunction with SPIKESbind, a complementary interactive educational app designed to enhance proficiency in interpreting binding pharmacological data.<br/>

								<p><span style="color:Red">Agonists</span> bind to and activate receptors to induce changes in the activity of the receptor-expressing
									cells – a simple schematic of this process, together with a short animation, can be seen by clicking the <span style="color:red">red <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> Agonist</span> icon. The
									magnitude of these agonist-induced changes in cell activity are dependent on the concentration of
									the agonist, and are typically displayed using agonist dose-response curves (see default sigmoid-
									shaped Agonist Dose-Response Curve).
								</p>
								<p>
									Agonist dose response curves provide important information regarding:
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>1.</b> The maximum level of effect (response) induced by the highest concentrations of agonist
									(expressed as a percentage of the maximum change in cell activity, %Emax), and
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>2.</b> The potency of the agonist, which is the concentration of the agonist producing a particular level
									of effect (response), usually expressed as the molar concentration of agonist producing 50% of the
									agonist’s maximum response (EC<sub>50</sub> value).
								</p>
								<p>
									The shape and position of agonist dose-response curves depend upon the properties of both the
									agonist (affinity and intrinsic efficacy) and the cell (receptor density and the signal amplification).
									Specific information about these parameters can be obtained by clicking the <span style="color:red">red <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> icons</span>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Relative values for the four agonist and cell parameters are represented by the red sliders, and can be
									changed by moving the sliders to the left (to decrease parameter value) or to the right (to increase
									parameter value) along the grey bar. Thus, this agonist dose-response visualiser enables you to
									visualise how the position and shape of the agonist dose-response curve changes in response to
									increases or decreases in agonist affinity or efficacy or in cell receptor density or signal amplification.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can enhance your understanding of these key concepts of agonism by working through a series
									of Questions (see Questions window) that encourage the use of the Dose-Response Visualiser (see
									the ‘Question’ window). An Answer to each of the Questions posed can be obtained by clicking on
									the Reveal Answer icon.
								</p>
								<p>
									<span style="color:red">Antagonists</span> bind to receptors and inhibit agonist-induced responses. There exist different classes of
									antagonists, including Competitive antagonists, Irreversible antagonists, Allosteric antagonists, 
									Functional antagonists and Inverse Agonists. As their names suggest, these different classes of antagonist interact with
									the receptors in distinct ways, and likewise affect agonist dose-response curves in characteristic
									ways – thus each class of antagonist has its own visualiser. Further information about each of these
									classes of antagonists can be obtained by clicking the <span style="color:red">red <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> Antagonist</span> icon in each specific window, to reveal a mechanistic overview and a short animation.
									The magnitude of inhibitory effects produced by an antagonist depends upon both the
									concentration and affinity of the antagonist. By default, the effects produced by 1, 10, 100 and 1000
									nM concentrations of antagonist on the agonist dose-response curves are displayed in red. These default 
									concentrations of antagonist can be individually altered by clicking on the up/down chevrons in the Table 
									located below the dose-response curves. The effect of changing the affinity of the antagonist on these effects 
									can also be visualised by moving the red sliders in the Antagonist window to the left (to decrease antagonist affinity) or to the right
									(to	increase antagonist affinity) along the grey bar. The extent to which the actions of the antagonist
									is dependent on the characteristics of the agonist (affinity, intrinsic efficacy) and/or cell (receptor
									density, signal amplification) can also be displayed by moving the appropriate sliders in the Agonist or
									Cell windows.
								</p>
								<p>
									A return to default parameter values can be accomplished by clicking on the <b>RESET</b> button.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can enhance your understanding of these key concepts of antagonism by working through a
									series of Questions (see Questions window) that encourage the use of the Dose-Response Visualiser
									(see the ‘Question’ window). An Answer to each of the Questions posed can be obtained by clicking
									on the Reveal Answer icon.

									Schild analyses enable the determination of the affinity (K<sub>B</sub>) of a competitive antagonist at a
									particular receptor that is mediating the response produced by an agonist. Thus, the Schild analysis

									various receptor subtypes.

									As shown in the Dose-Response Visualiser, competitive antagonists produce a parallel, rightward
									shift of the agonist dose-response curve with no reduction in the maximum agonist-induced effect.
									The magnitude of the rightward shift increases as the [competitive antagonist] increases, and the
									magnitude of the shift (Dose Ratio) can be used to measure the affinity of the competitive
									antagonist for the receptor (Schild analysis). The Schild Plot plots the –log[antagonist] (M) on the x-
									axis against the calculated log(DR-1) on the y-axis (as can be seen in the Schild Plot window).
								</p>
								<p>
									If certain conditions are met (plot is linear with a slope of 1.0), then a Schild Plot can be used to generate a
									pA<sub>2</sub> value, which is an estimate of the affinity of the competitive antagonist (K<sub>B</sub> value) for the
									receptor through which the agonist is producing the response. The pA<sub>2</sub> is determined by measuring
									the value of the dose ratio (DR) at several antagonist concentrations, allowing an estimate of the
									antagonist concentration at which log(DR-1) is zero.
								</p>
								<p>
									The calculated –logK<sub>B</sub> value of the antagonist can then be compared to known –logK<sub>i</sub> values of the
									antagonist obtained from the binding of the antagonist to pure populations of receptor subtypes,
									and through a process of elimination (incorporating the SPIKES approach), the receptor mediating
									the agonist-induced response identified.

									<b><i>In the Schild Plot Generator</i></b> you can choose the characteristics of the agonist (affinity, intrinsic
									efficacy) and cell (receptor density, signal amplification) by moving the red sliders along the grey
									bar (as per Dose-Response Visualiser). Furthermore, you can select the characteristics of the antagonist
									 (e.g. affinity in the Competitive Antagonist window) and select up to four [antagonist] (in the Schild Plot Analysis
									window) for use in the Schild Analysis, by entering specific values or by using the up/down chevrons.
									The Schild Plot Generator determines the [Agonist] that produces 50%Emax for each agonist dose-
									response curve to calculate the dose ratio and log(DR-1) values, which are presented within the
									Schild Analysis Table. The log(DR-1) values for the 4 [antagonist] are then plotted to generate the
									idealised Schild Plot. Any of the agonist, cell of antagonist parameters can be changed at any time
									and the effect on the Schild plot shown in real time. A return to default parameter values can be
									accomplished by clicking on the <b>RESET</b> button.

								<p>
									You can enhance your understanding of the key concepts surrounding the theoretical and practical
									aspects of Schild Analysis by working through a series of Questions (see Questions window) that
									encourage the use of the Schild Plot Generator and the Reference Table of ‘-logK<sub>i</sub>  values’. An Answer
									to each of the Questions posed can be obtained by clicking on the Reveal Answer icon. Completing these
									questions, together with an understanding of the SPIKES approach to interpreting Schild plot data,
									will prepare you well for the ‘Schild Plot Analysis Quiz’.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first (default) page you will see in the Schild Plot Generator is the “Schild Plot Generator for Competitive 
									Antagonist”.  In addition, you can also investigate how non-competitive antagonists, such as irreversible, 
									allosteric and functional antagonists produce Schild Plots that are typically nonlinear and/or have a slope 
									not equal to 1.0.  You will notice that the different types of antagonist produce quite distinct types of 
									Schild Plot.  For example, whereas irreversible antagonists always produce Schild plots with a slope > 1.0, 
									allosteric antagonists will generally produce Schild Plots with a slope < 1.0.  The inclusion of these 
									non-competitive antagonists in the Schild plot generator is primarily for illustrative purposes, 
									and not to suggest that such non-ideal Schild plots can be used to generate legitimate –logK<sub>B</sub> 
									values from the pA<sub>2</sub> value.  
								</p>
								<p>
									Although Schild Plots for competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope not significantly different 
									from 1.0 (ideal), there are many instances in the published scientific literature of ‘non-ideal’ Schild Plots, 
									where the plot is nonlinear or has a slope different from 1.0.  ‘Non-ideal’ Schild Plots to competitive 
									antagonists typically reflect non-ideal experimental conditions.  In the “Schild Plot Generator”, the 
									‘Non-Ideal Schild Plot’ page provides illustrations of some of the ways that Schild Plots can deviate 
									from being ideal (e.g. nonlinear with a slope < 1.0 at low concentrations of the antagonist), while also 
									providing mechanistic insights and potential remedies.

									The ‘Schild Plot Analysis Quiz’ presents you with a series of Schild Plots obtained to 5 antagonists
									acting on a single receptor subtype within a common cell. The challenge is to analyse each of the
									Schild Plots to deduce which single receptor subtype is mediating the agonist-induced response.
								</p>
								<p>
									A key factor in determining which receptor subtype is mediating the response is the application of
									the SPIKES approach. SPIKES is a mnemonic that provides a stepwise approach for analysing Schild
									plots.

									<b>Assumptions made in the Schild Plot Analysis Quiz</b><br>
									<b>1. Linearity is assessed by visual inspection.</b> As indicated in the video above (SPIKES approach 1), 
									determining that a Schild plot is linear requires statistical testing (e.g. Analysis of Covariance) 
									of many replicates of the Schild plot that have been obtained experimentally.  For the purposes of the 
									Schild Plot Analysis Quiz, linearity is confirmed by visual inspection – presented Schild Plots will 
									either be linear or obviously nonlinear.<br>
									<b>2. Inclination (slope) is assessed by visual inspection.</b> As indicated in the video above (SPIKES approach 1), 
									determining that a Schild plot has a slope that is not different from 1.0 requires statistical testing 
									(e.g. use of 95% confidence intervals) of many replicates of the Schild plot that have been obtained 
									experimentally.  For the purposes of the Schild Plot Analysis Quiz, slope is confirmed by visual 
									inspection – presented Schild Plots will either have a slope that 1.0 or a slope that is obviously 
									different from 1.0.<br>
									<b>3. Elimination is based on a difference of at least 1.0 between –logKB value and –logKi values.</b> 
									As indicated in the video above (SPIKES approach 2), the elimination process is based on the known –logKi 
									values laying outside the 95% confidence intervals of the–logKB value of the antagonist determined using 
									many replicates of the Schild plot that have been obtained experimentally.  For the purposes of the Schild 
									Plot Analysis Quiz, a –logKi values is assumed to be different from a –logKB value if there is a difference 
									of 1.0 log unit of more.
