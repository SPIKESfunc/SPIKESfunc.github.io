					Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  If these criteria are met then the antagonist pA<sub>2</sub> value (derived from the x-intercept) can typically be used as a measure of the affinity (-logK<sub>B</sub>) of the antagonist for the receptor mediating the agonist-induce response.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, if should be recognised that a linear Schild plot with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0 provides only presumptive evidence of competitive antagonism, not proof of competitive antagonism.  For example, under some restrictive conditions (e.g. use of a narrow antagonist concentration range), there are instances of allosteric, irreversible and functional antagonists generating Schild plots that satisfy the conditions of linearity and unit slope.  Thus, confirmatory evidence of competitive antagonism should be obtained from binding studies that directly evaluate the molecular interactions between ligands and receptors.
				</p>

				<p><span style="color: blue;"> <b>A clear strength of the Schild analysis is that the shape and position of the Schild plot should be: </b></span></p>

					<li>Independent of the characteristics of the cell or tissue, such as receptor density and signal amplification </li>
					<li>Independent of the characteristics of the agonist used, including affinity and efficacy</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					When used in conjunction with receptor-selective antagonists, the Schild analysis offers a powerful method for characterising receptor function in cells and tissues.

				<h3> Schild plot is linear with unit slope, but generates unreliable pA<sub>2</sub> values </h3> <br>

				<br><br><p>
					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  Typically, if these criteria are met then the antagonist pA<sub>2</sub> value (derived from the x-intercept) can theoretically be used as a measure of the affinity (-logK<sub>B</sub>) of the antagonist for the receptor mediating the agonist-induce response.   
				</p>
				<p>
					However, there are instances whereby linear Schild plots with unit slope have generated pA<sub>2</sub> values that are not accurate estimates of the actual affinity of the antagonist for the receptor (-logK<sub>B</sub> value).  There are several mechanisms through which this phenomenon might occur, including the following.
				</p>
				
		
				<p><span style="color: blue;"> <b> The competitive antagonist has not been equilibrated with the tissue for sufficient time</b></span></p>

				<p>
					If an antagonist cannot readily penetrate into a tissue (diffusion is a rate-limiting step), then the use of shorter-than-optimum equilibration times will generate Schild plots that are positioned to the right of plots obtained when longer, more appropriate equilibration times have been used (Kenakin, 1982).  Thus, the effect of a shorter-than-optimum equilibration time will be to under-estimate both the pA<sub>2</sub> and affinity of the antagonist.  Of course, <i><b> this issue can be remedied by increasing the period of exposure of the antagonist such that complete equilibration of the antagonist with the receptor is achieved. </i></b>
				</p>

				<p><span style="color: blue;"> <b> Additional drugs are being used in the study that also interact with the receptor </b></span></p>

				<p>
					It is often necessary to use additional drugs in Schild plot studies e.g. to inhibit uptake processes, degradative enzymes, and/or other receptor subtypes. If an additional drug, for example an uptake inhibitor, also possesses considerable receptor blocking activity, then the Schild plot for the competitive antagonist will be displaced to the right (proportional to the concentration of the uptake inhibitor).  Such an effect will result in under-estimation of both the pA<sub>2</sub> and affinity of the antagonist (Kenakin, 1982). <i><b> This issue can be remedied by changing the additional drugs used to particular drugs that do not have an action at the receptor of interest.</i></b>

				<h3> Schild plot is nonlinear with a slope > 1.0 at low concentrations </h3> <br>

				<br><br><p>
					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  However, there are several instances whereby the Schild plot deviates from linearity at low concentrations of antagonist, and the slope in this region of the plot is greater than 1.0 (see figure above).  This effect is typically indicative of several mechanisms, as follows:
				</p>
			
				<p><b><span style="color: blue;"> The competitive antagonist is a substrate of a saturable uptake system</span></b></p>

				<p>
					If the antagonist is a substrate of a saturable uptake system, then the concentration of the antagonist in the vicinity of the receptor is less than that predicted based on the concentration administered (to the solution surrounding the cells or tissue), resulting in a lower-than-expected level of antagonism of an agonist-induced response (smaller than predicted DR value). However, at higher concentrations of the antagonist, the uptake system becomes saturated and the concentration of antagonist in the vicinity of the receptor is closer to that predicted based on the dose administered, and the expected level of antagonism is produced.  
				</p>
				<p>
					<i> <b>This issue can be remedied by blocking the saturable uptake system for which the antagonist is a substrate. </b> </i>
				</p>

				<p><b> </span> <span style="color: blue;"> The competitive antagonist has not been equilibrated with the tissue for sufficient time </span></b></p>

				<p>
					If an antagonist cannot readily equilibrate with the receptor, then lower concentrations of the antagonist require a longer period of time to equilibrate than higher concentrations.  Thus, if the equilibration time is shorter than that required for the lowest concentration of antagonist used, then these lower concentrations will be less effective and produce lower DR values than predicted (see Fig. 2, Kenakin, 1982, p257) – resulting in slopes greater than one at the lower regions of the Schild plot.
				</p>

				<p>
					<i> <b>Of course, this issue can be remedied by increasing the period of exposure of the antagonist such that equilibration of the antagonist with the receptor is achieved.</b> </i>

				<br><br><p>
					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0.  However, there are some well-documented examples where the Schild plot deviates from linearity at low concentrations of antagonist, such that the slope in this region of the plot is less than 1.0 (see figure above).  This effect is typically related to the properties of the agonist, rather than the antagonist. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If the <span style="color: blue;"><b>agonist is a substrate of a saturable uptake system</b></span>, then the concentration of the agonist in the vicinity of the receptor is less than that predicted based on the concentration administered (to the solution surrounding the cells or tissue), resulting in a lower-than-expected level of agonist-induced response – this will be particular evident in the control (no antagonist) agonist dose-response curve and those completed in the presence of low concentrations of antagonist. However, when higher concentrations of the agonist are used (e.g. in the presence of higher concentrations of the competitive antagonist) the uptake system for the agonist becomes saturated and the concentration of agonist in the vicinity of the receptor will be closer to that predicted based on the concentration administered, and the expected level of antagonism is produced (see Figure).  
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This effect has been extensively reported in relation to studies characterising adrenoceptors, as some adrenoceptor agonists (e.g. noradrenaline) are substrates of neuronal uptake systems, whereas other agonists (e.g. isoprenaline) are not substrates (Kenakin, 1982). The magnitude of effect will depend on the tissue being investigated as the characteristics of saturable uptake systems varies considerably.  Of particular note, pA<sub>2</sub> values obtained for antagonists when neuronal uptake of the agonist has not been blocked are unlikely to provide reliable measures of antagonist affinity.    				</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b> This issue can be remedied by blocking the saturable uptake system for which the agonist is a substrate, for example by using cocaine to block the neuronal uptake of noradrenaline.   </b></i>

					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0. However, if the Schild plot deviates from linearity at high concentrations of antagonist, such that the slope in this region of the plot is greater than 1.0 (see figure above), then this may indicate that <span style="color: blue;" > <b>high concentrations of either the agonist or antagonist are producing toxicity in these cells or tissue. </b></span>
				</p>

				<p>
					A characteristic feature of toxicity is reduced responsiveness of the cells/tissue to agonists, which is manifest as a decrease in agonist potency and maximum effect.  Thus, if only high concentrations (of agonist or antagonist) are producing toxicity, then elevated DR values produced by the combined effects of antagonist and toxicity will only be evident in the latter phases of the Schild plot.  In this instance, the lower concentrations of antagonist that are non-toxic can be reliably used to generate pA<sub>2</sub> values and logK<sub>B</sub> values (if that portion of the Schild plot is linear with unit slope).   
				</p>

				<p>
					Of course,<b><i> this issue can be remedied by using competitive antagonists and agonists that are non-toxic.  As toxicity is typically concentration-dependent, the use of highly potent agonists and antagonists will likely be advantageous in this setting.     </i></b>

					Ideally Schild plots obtained to competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope that is not significantly different from 1.0. As mentioned elsewhere, this plateauing of the Schild plot at high concentrations of antagonist is typically seen with allosteric antagonists. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					However, this phenomenon may also be observed with competitive antagonists under certain conditions (Kenakin, 1982), as indicated below.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						<b>High concentrations of antagonist increases the sensitivity of the tissue to the agonist </b>
					</li>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						<b>High concentrations of the antagonist produce agonist-like responses in the tissue</b>
					</li>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						<b>High concentrations of the agonist activates a second type of receptor/pathway that mediates the same response, but which is not blocked by the antagonist</b>
					</li>
					<li style="color: blue;">
						<b>High concentrations of the agonist release an endogenous agonist that overcomes the	effects produced by the antagonist 	</b>
					</li>
				</ol>

							<b>Project Summary</b><br/>
							Agonists produce effects in cells by activating receptors and downstream signalling pathways. This app contains an interactive “Dose Response Visualiser” which allows users to alter agonist-dependent factors (affinity, intrinsic efficacy) and/or cell-dependent factors (receptor density, signal amplification) and observe in real time how this changes the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Agonist-induced effects can be blocked by drugs called antagonists, which are amongst the most widely used class of drug in medicine. There exist many different types of antagonists, named on the basis of how they inhibit the agonist-induced effect: competitive, irreversible, allosteric and functional antagonists, and inverse agonists. Within the “Dose Response Visualiser”, users can observe the different patterns of effect produced by each of these antagonists (and the influence of antagonist concentrations and affinity) on the agonist dose-response relationship.<br/>
							<br/>Quantitative analysis of the effect of competitive antagonists on agonist-induced effects is a powerful method for identifying the receptors that mediate agonist-induced effects (Schild analysis), and is used in drug discovery and receptor characterisation. The app contains a “Schild Plot Generator”, where users can select the properties of agonists and antagonists and generate Schild Plots, and work through a series of theoretical questions and experimental scenarios that build proficiency and enhance understanding of key Schild concepts.  The “Schild Plot Generator” also introduces users to a wide array of ‘non-ideal’ Schild Plots (e.g. nonlinear and/or slope different from unity), and moreover, provides users with information that can be used to identify and remedy the underlying causes of each form of ‘non-ideal’ Schild plot.<br/>
							<br/>These newly developed proficiencies and understandings can then be tested using the “Schild Analysis Quiz” tool within the app, were users are provided with a series of Schild Plots obtained to 5 antagonists acting on a single receptor subtype within a common cell, and users are challenged to analyse each of the Schild Plots using the SPIKES approach to deduce which single receptor subtype is mediating the agonist-induced response.  Feedback is provided for each of the 1000s of different quiz questions.<br/>
							<br/>Additonally, there is access to various videos and detailed descriptions on non-ideal schild plots.<br/> 
							<br/>Thus, SPIKESfunc is an interactive, educational application that boosts proficiency in the interpretation of functional pharmacological data through the visual and quantitative analysis of agonist and antagonist dose-response relationships. SPIKESfunc can be used in conjunction with SPIKESbind, a complementary interactive educational app designed to enhance proficiency in interpreting binding pharmacological data.<br/>

									cells – a simple schematic of this process, together with a short animation, can be seen by clicking the <span style="color:red">red <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> Agonist</span> icon. The
									magnitude of these agonist-induced changes in cell activity are dependent on the concentration of
									the agonist, and are typically displayed using agonist dose-response curves (see default sigmoid-
									shaped Agonist Dose-Response Curve).
								</p>
								<p>
									Agonist dose response curves provide important information regarding:
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>1.</b> The maximum level of effect (response) induced by the highest concentrations of agonist
									(expressed as a percentage of the maximum change in cell activity, %Emax), and
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>2.</b> The potency of the agonist, which is the concentration of the agonist producing a particular level
									of effect (response), usually expressed as the molar concentration of agonist producing 50% of the
									agonist’s maximum response (EC<sub>50</sub> value).
								</p>
								<p>
									The shape and position of agonist dose-response curves depend upon the properties of both the
									agonist (affinity and intrinsic efficacy) and the cell (receptor density and the signal amplification).
									Specific information about these parameters can be obtained by clicking the <span style="color:red">red <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> icons</span>.

								<p>
									Relative values for the four agonist and cell parameters are represented by the red sliders, and can be
									changed by moving the sliders to the left (to decrease parameter value) or to the right (to increase
									parameter value) along the grey bar. Thus, this agonist dose-response visualiser enables you to
									visualise how the position and shape of the agonist dose-response curve changes in response to
									increases or decreases in agonist affinity or efficacy or in cell receptor density or signal amplification.

									You can enhance your understanding of these key concepts of agonism by working through a series

									<span style="color:red">Antagonists</span> bind to receptors and inhibit agonist-induced responses. There exist different classes of
									antagonists, including Competitive antagonists, Irreversible antagonists, Allosteric antagonists, 
									Functional antagonists and Inverse Agonists. As their names suggest, these different classes of antagonist interact with
									the receptors in distinct ways, and likewise affect agonist dose-response curves in characteristic
									ways – thus each class of antagonist has its own visualiser. Further information about each of these
									classes of antagonists can be obtained by clicking the <span style="color:red">red <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> Antagonist</span> icon in each specific window, to reveal a mechanistic overview and a short animation.
									The magnitude of inhibitory effects produced by an antagonist depends upon both the
									concentration and affinity of the antagonist. By default, the effects produced by 1, 10, 100 and 1000
									nM concentrations of antagonist on the agonist dose-response curves are displayed in red. These default 
									concentrations of antagonist can be individually altered by clicking on the up/down chevrons in the Table

									can also be visualised by moving the red sliders in the Antagonist window to the left (to decrease antagonist affinity) or to the right
									(to	increase antagonist affinity) along the grey bar. The extent to which the actions of the antagonist

									Schild analyses enable the determination of the affinity (K<sub>B</sub>) of a competitive antagonist at a
									particular receptor that is mediating the response produced by an agonist. Thus, the Schild analysis
									is a particularly powerful approach for classifying and identifying the functional roles played by
									various receptor subtypes.

								<br><p>
									As shown in the Dose-Response Visualiser, competitive antagonists produce a parallel, rightward
									shift of the agonist dose-response curve with no reduction in the maximum agonist-induced effect.
									The magnitude of the rightward shift increases as the [competitive antagonist] increases, and the
									magnitude of the shift (Dose Ratio) can be used to measure the affinity of the competitive
									antagonist for the receptor (Schild analysis). The Schild Plot plots the –log[antagonist] (M) on the x-
									axis against the calculated log(DR-1) on the y-axis (as can be seen in the Schild Plot window).
								</p>
								<p>
									If certain conditions are met (plot is linear with a slope of 1.0), then a Schild Plot can be used to generate a
									pA<sub>2</sub> value, which is an estimate of the affinity of the competitive antagonist (K<sub>B</sub> value) for the
									receptor through which the agonist is producing the response. The pA<sub>2</sub> is determined by measuring
									the value of the dose ratio (DR) at several antagonist concentrations, allowing an estimate of the
									antagonist concentration at which log(DR-1) is zero.
								</p>
								<p>
									The calculated –logK<sub>B</sub> value of the antagonist can then be compared to known –logK<sub>i</sub> values of the
									antagonist obtained from the binding of the antagonist to pure populations of receptor subtypes,
									and through a process of elimination (incorporating the SPIKES approach), the receptor mediating
									the agonist-induced response identified.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><i>In the Schild Plot Generator</i></b> you can choose the characteristics of the agonist (affinity, intrinsic
									efficacy) and cell (receptor density, signal amplification) by moving the red sliders along the grey
									bar (as per Dose-Response Visualiser). Furthermore, you can select the characteristics of the antagonist
									 (e.g. affinity in the Competitive Antagonist window) and select up to four [antagonist] (in the Schild Plot Analysis
									window) for use in the Schild Analysis, by entering specific values or by using the up/down chevrons.
									The Schild Plot Generator determines the [Agonist] that produces 50%Emax for each agonist dose-
									response curve to calculate the dose ratio and log(DR-1) values, which are presented within the
									Schild Analysis Table. The log(DR-1) values for the 4 [antagonist] are then plotted to generate the
									idealised Schild Plot. Any of the agonist, cell of antagonist parameters can be changed at any time
									and the effect on the Schild plot shown in real time. A return to default parameter values can be
									accomplished by clicking on the <b>RESET</b> button.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can enhance your understanding of the key concepts surrounding the theoretical and practical
									aspects of Schild Analysis by working through a series of Questions (see Questions window) that
									encourage the use of the Schild Plot Generator and the Reference Table of ‘-logK<sub>i</sub>  values’. An Answer
									to each of the Questions posed can be obtained by clicking on the Reveal Answer icon. Completing these
									questions, together with an understanding of the SPIKES approach to interpreting Schild plot data,
									will prepare you well for the ‘Schild Plot Analysis Quiz’.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first (default) page you will see in the Schild Plot Generator is the “Schild Plot Generator for Competitive 
									Antagonist”.  In addition, you can also investigate how non-competitive antagonists, such as irreversible, 
									allosteric and functional antagonists produce Schild Plots that are typically nonlinear and/or have a slope 
									not equal to 1.0.  You will notice that the different types of antagonist produce quite distinct types of 
									Schild Plot.  For example, whereas irreversible antagonists always produce Schild plots with a slope > 1.0, 
									allosteric antagonists will generally produce Schild Plots with a slope < 1.0.  The inclusion of these 
									non-competitive antagonists in the Schild plot generator is primarily for illustrative purposes, 
									and not to suggest that such non-ideal Schild plots can be used to generate legitimate –logK<sub>B</sub> 
									values from the pA<sub>2</sub> value.  
								</p>
								<p>
									Although Schild Plots for competitive antagonists should be linear with a slope not significantly different 
									from 1.0 (ideal), there are many instances in the published scientific literature of ‘non-ideal’ Schild Plots, 
									where the plot is nonlinear or has a slope different from 1.0.  ‘Non-ideal’ Schild Plots to competitive 
									antagonists typically reflect non-ideal experimental conditions.  In the “Schild Plot Generator”, the 
									‘Non-Ideal Schild Plot’ page provides illustrations of some of the ways that Schild Plots can deviate 
									from being ideal (e.g. nonlinear with a slope < 1.0 at low concentrations of the antagonist), while also 
									providing mechanistic insights and potential remedies. 
								</p>

									The ‘Schild Plot Analysis Quiz’ presents you with a series of Schild Plots obtained to 5 antagonists
									acting on a single receptor subtype within a common cell. The challenge is to analyse each of the
									Schild Plots to deduce which single receptor subtype is mediating the agonist-induced response.
								</p>
								<p>
									A key factor in determining which receptor subtype is mediating the response is the application of
									the SPIKES approach. SPIKES is a mnemonic that provides a stepwise approach for analysing Schild
									plots.

									pA<sub>2</sub> value and the known –logK<sub>i</sub> value at any particular receptor subtype (see reference Table of
									–logK<sub>i</sub> values), then that receptor subtype is unlikely to have mediated the agonist-induced response
									and can be eliminated from further analysis. In the Quiz, for each antagonist check the receptor box
									to indicate that that receptor has been eliminated.

									eliminate one or more receptor subtypes as having mediated the agonist-induced response. By using
									the information obtained by using ALL the antagonists, a concerted process of elimination should
									leave just one receptor subtype as having mediated the response induced by the agonist. All
									obtained pA<sub>2</sub> values should be close to the –logK<sub>i</sub> values for the sole non-eliminated receptor. In the
									Quiz, in the ‘Your Solution’ window select the sole receptor subtype that is mediating the response.

									An additional feature of the Quiz is the inclusion of a hypothetical antagonist called Ant3311. 
									The Schild plot for Ant3311 will not satisfy the requirements of linearity and/or unity of slope. 
									In the Quiz, based on your analysis of the Ant3311 Schild plot and your understanding of why Schild 
									plots may be nonlinear and/or have an slope different from 1.0 (as outlined in the Schild Plot 
									Generator), enter the most appropriate description of why Ant3311 Schild Plot is not ideal from the 
									drop-down options (‘Ant3311 is an allosteric antagonist at this receptor’, ‘Ant3311 is an irreversible 
									antagonist at this receptor’, ‘Ant3311 is toxic to cells at high concentrations’, ‘Ant3311 is a 
									substrate of a saturable uptake process’). To submit all your answers, click on the ‘Submit Answers’ 
									button. This will take you to a new page that will indicate whether your submitted Answers were 
									correct or incorrect. If your answers are correct, then you will receive affirmation of this, 
									and have the option of starting a ‘New Quiz’. 
								</p>
								<p>
									If either of your answers is incorrect, then you will receive immediate feedback – 
									both the selected and correct answers will be presented side-by-side in visual form, with explanations.  
									You then have the opportunity to ‘learn more’ (by visiting the Schild Plot Generator pages), ‘amend your 
									answers’ or to start a ‘new quiz’ by clicking the appropriate button.

									<b>Assumptions made in the Schild Plot Analysis Quiz</b><br>
									<b>1. Linearity is assessed by visual inspection.</b> As indicated in the video above (SPIKES approach 1), 
									determining that a Schild plot is linear requires statistical testing (e.g. Analysis of Covariance) 
									of many replicates of the Schild plot that have been obtained experimentally.  For the purposes of the 
									Schild Plot Analysis Quiz, linearity is confirmed by visual inspection – presented Schild Plots will 
									either be linear or obviously nonlinear.<br>
									<b>2. Inclination (slope) is assessed by visual inspection.</b> As indicated in the video above (SPIKES approach 1), 
									determining that a Schild plot has a slope that is not different from 1.0 requires statistical testing 
									(e.g. use of 95% confidence intervals) of many replicates of the Schild plot that have been obtained 
									experimentally.  For the purposes of the Schild Plot Analysis Quiz, slope is confirmed by visual 
									inspection – presented Schild Plots will either have a slope that 1.0 or a slope that is obviously 
									different from 1.0.<br>
									<b>3. Elimination is based on a difference of at least 1.0 between –logK<sub>B</sub> value and –logKi values.</b> 
									As indicated in the video above (SPIKES approach 2), the elimination process is based on the known –logKi 
									values laying outside the 95% confidence intervals of the–logK<sub>B</sub> value of the antagonist determined using 
									many replicates of the Schild plot that have been obtained experimentally.  For the purposes of the Schild 
									Plot Analysis Quiz, a –logKi values is assumed to be different from a –logK<sub>B</sub> value if there is a difference 
									of 1.0 log unit of more.
